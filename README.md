# Arkito
Welcome to the Arkito game engine by L0raxeo!

Arkito is a 2D game engine for Java that handles the majority of the backend part of your game! All you have to do is focus on making the worlds and stories that you want to make. Arkito is the second version of the Arki game engine with many refactored, improved, and new features. Arkito will help you manage everything from the game thread, rendering, and asset loading to the collision systems, event systems, and physics simulations.
